# MVC 
Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern[1] commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.

# MODEL
The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.[5] It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

# VIEW
The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. For example, the Customer view will include all the UI components such as text boxes, dropdowns, etc. that the final user interacts with.

# CONTROLLER
Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output.
